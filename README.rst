    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/backports.inspect/
    :alt: Latest Version

This is a backport of (some) `Python 3.3 inspect module`_ features to
2.7 (piggybacking on `aliles/funcsigs`_).

**NOTE:** While `aliles/funcsigs`_ targets Python 2.6 *and* 2.7,
`backports.inspect` *only* targets 2.7.

**BUGS:** There are currently no unit tests :-( ...which must mean
there are no bugs! :-) We welcome issues to expose this assertion as
incorrect, and pull requests to rectify that...
