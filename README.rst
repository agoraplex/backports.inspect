====================
`backports.inspect`_
====================

This is a backport of (some) `Python 3 inspect module`_ features to
2.7 (piggybacking on `aliles/funcsigs`_).

**NOTE:** While `aliles/funcsigs`_ targets Python 2.6 *and* 2.7,
`backports.inspect` *only* targets 2.7.

**BUGS:** There are currently no unit tests :-( ...which must mean
there are no bugs! :-) We welcome issues to expose this assertion as
incorrect, and pull requests to rectify that...

`backports.inspect`_ is licensed under the BSD "3-clause" license. See
`LICENSE`_ for details. The original `Python 3 inspect module`_, from
which most (all?) of this library is derived, is in the public domain.
